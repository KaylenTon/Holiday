Description: The 'Holiday' package provides festive color palettes, plot themes, 
    and fun date-based utilities for data visualizations inspired by popular holidays. 
    'Holiday' makes it easy to style ggplot2 graphics with seasonal colors and moods 
    such as Christmas, Valentine’s Day, Halloween, Easter, Lunar New Year, and more. 
    Users can access custom color palettes through 'holiday_palette()', apply themed 
    ggplot2 styles with 'theme_holiday()', and even check how many days remain until 
    a given holiday using 'holiday_countdown()'. Additional features, such as 
    'plot_countdown()', visualize upcoming holidays in a cheerful and colorful way. 
    The package aims to bring creativity and festivity to data storytelling all year round.
